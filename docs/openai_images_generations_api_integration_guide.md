# OpenAI Images Generations API Application and Usage

DALL-E 3 is an image generation model developed by OpenAI that can generate high-quality images based on text descriptions.

This document mainly introduces the usage process of the OpenAI Images Generations API, which allows us to easily utilize the image generation capabilities of the official OpenAI DALL-E.

## Application Process

To use the OpenAI Images Generations API, you can first visit the [OpenAI Images Generations API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/fd932485-90c7-45d6-8394-1e14b6f07b2b) page and click the "Acquire" button to obtain the credentials needed for the request:

If you are not logged in or registered, you will be automatically redirected to the login page inviting you to register and log in. After logging in or registering, you will be automatically returned to the current page.

When applying for the first time, there will be a free quota available for you to use the API for free.

## Basic Usage

Next, you can fill in the corresponding content on the interface, as shown in the figure:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/zv58ug.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

When using this interface for the first time, we need to fill in at least three pieces of information: one is `authorization`, which can be selected directly from the dropdown list. The other parameter is `model`, which is the category of the OpenAI DALL-E model we choose to use; here we mainly have one model, and details can be found in the models we provide. The last parameter is `prompt`, which is the input for the image generation prompt.

You can also notice that there is corresponding code generation on the right side; you can copy the code to run directly or click the "Try" button for testing.

Python sample call code:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/openai/images/generations"

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer {token}",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "model": "dall-e-3",
    "prompt": "A cute baby sea otter"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

After the call, we find the returned result as follows:

```json
{
  "created": 1721626477,
  "data": [
    {
      "revised_prompt": "A delightful image showcasing a young sea otter, who is born brown, with wide charming eyes. It is delightfully lying on its back, paddling in the calm sea waters. Its dense, velvety fur appears wet and shimmering, capturing the essence of its habitat. The small creature curiously plays with a sea shell with its small paws, looking absolutely innocent and charming in its natural environment.",
      "url": "https://dalleprodsec.blob.core.windows.net/private/images/5d98aa7c-80c6-4523-b571-fc606ad455b9/generated_00.png?se=2024-07-23T05%3A34%3A48Z&sig=GAz%2Bi3%2BkHOQwAMhxcv22tBM%2FaexrxPgT9V0DbNrL4ik%3D&ske=2024-07-23T08%3A41%3A10Z&skoid=e52d5ed7-0657-4f62-bc12-7e5dbb260a96&sks=b&skt=2024-07-16T08%3A41%3A10Z&sktid=33e01921-4d64-4f8c-a055-5bdaffd5e33d&skv=2020-10-02&sp=r&spr=https&sr=b&sv=2020-10-02"
    }
  ]
}
```

The returned result contains multiple fields, described as follows:

- `created`, the ID generated for this image generation, used to uniquely identify this task.
- `data`, which contains the result information of the image generation.

The `data` includes specific information about the images generated by the model, and the `url` inside it is the detailed link to the generated image, as shown in the figure.

## Image Quality Parameter `quality`

Next, we will introduce how to set some detailed parameters for the image generation results, among which the image quality parameter `quality` includes two types: the first `standard` indicates generating standard images, and the other `hd` indicates that the created images have finer details and greater consistency.

Below, we set the image quality parameter to `standard`, with specific settings as shown in the figure:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/1q303w.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

You can also notice that there is corresponding code generation on the right side; you can copy the code to run directly or click the "Try" button for testing.

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer {token}",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "model": "dall-e-3",
    "prompt": "A cute baby sea otter",
    "quality": "standard"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

After the call, we find the returned result as follows:

```json
{
  "created": 1721636023,
  "data": [
    {
      "revised_prompt": "A cute baby sea otter is lying playfully on its back in the water, with its fur looking glossy and soft. One of its tiny paws is reaching out curiously, and it has an expression of pure joy and warmth on its face as it looks up to the sky. Its body is surrounded by bubbles from its playful twirling in the water. A gentle breeze is playing with its fur making it look more charming. The scene portrays the tranquility and charm of marine life.",
      "url": "https://dalleprodsec.blob.core.windows.net/private/images/a93ee5e7-3abd-4923-8d79-dc9ef126da46/generated_00.png?se=2024-07-23T08%3A13%3A55Z&sig=wTXGYvUOwUIkaB2CxjK9ww%2FHjS8OwYUWcYInXYKwcAM%3D&ske=2024-07-23T11%3A32%3A05Z&skoid=e52d5ed7-0657-4f62-bc12-7e5dbb260a96&sks=b&skt=2024-07-16T11%3A32%3A05Z&sktid=33e01921-4d64-4f8c-a055-5bdaffd5e33d&skv=2020-10-02&sp=r&spr=https&sr=b&sv=2020-10-02"
    }
  ]
}
```

The returned result is consistent with the basic usage content, and we can see the generated image with the image quality parameter set to `standard` as shown in the figure:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/j5v15b.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

With the same operation as above, simply setting the image quality parameter to `hd` can yield the image shown in the figure below:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/vjpbqr.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

It can be seen that the images generated with `hd` have finer details and greater consistency compared to those generated with `standard`.

## Image Size Parameter `size`
We can also set the size of the generated images, and we can make the following settings.

The size of the image is set to `1024 * 1024`, the specific settings are shown in the figure below:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/dx5rwh.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/o4pvvx.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

With the same operation as above, simply changing the image size to `1792 * 1024`, we can obtain the image shown below:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/4pilae.png)

It can be seen that the image sizes are obviously different, and more sizes can be set. For detailed information, please refer to our official documentation.

## Image Style Parameter `style`

The image style parameter `style` includes two parameters, the first one `vivid` indicates that the generated image is more vivid, while the other `natural` indicates that the generated image is more natural.

The image style parameter is set to `vivid`, the specific settings are shown in the figure below:
